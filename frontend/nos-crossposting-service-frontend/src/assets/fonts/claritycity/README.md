# Clarity City

![Clarity City Typeface](./clarity-city.png)

Clarity City is an open source sans-serif typeface. It is the default font for the VMware Clarity Design System.

We have provided the files in OpenType, TrueType, and WebFont (EOT, WOFF, WOFF2) file formats.

## Support & Contributions

Please use GitHub issues for reporting problems, and before submitting contributions please open an issue to discuss your proposed changes. We will consider contributions, though we aim to keep a very stable font and limit releases to essential changes and fixes.

_We are not a type foundry, and while we are releasing this as an open source project our ability to make changes is limited. We work with partners to make improvements over time, so changes and feedback may take longer to implement._
